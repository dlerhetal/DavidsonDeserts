# DavidsonDeserts
Project 3, Group 2, Davidson County Food Insecurity (Food Deserts)

**** Overview and  purpose**** 
We created an interactive map of Davidson County census tracts, discovering which communities struggle with extreme poverty and food insecurity, and comparing that with local available grocery resources.

**** Instructions on how to use and interact with the projec****t
* Here is the link to our interactive map: https://dlerhetal.github.io/DesertDemo/
* This map will show each neighborhood tract of Davidson County, color-coded by its poverty rate.
* The user may select any geographical area by selecting a tract region on the map. Demographic information will be displayed.
* The user may also view the various locations to access groceries, which are sized by the quality of food (as based on their yelp rating)

**** Ethical Considerations made in the project****
* When describing an “impoverished area”  - can’t access food stamp or similar private info that could be helpful in the analysis.
* We, as users, give and use this data, but why is it so difficult to retrieve it?
* We realize that the ratings of the grocery stores could be skewed because not everyone is ranking a store after shopping, especially if they had a good experience
